# testify

A platform to help recruiting outstanding PHP developers.

# Idea

We should be able to have several tests with expected input/output results. From this tool we should be able to send a token that can be used for a specific candidate. With that token an test id he will be able to send the results back to us. This system should create a branch in your repo and commit the code. Some tests should run to validate the candidate solution.

# Roadmap

- System to create tests
- System to retrieve and validate tests
- Create branch in your repo
- Send emails to notify people
